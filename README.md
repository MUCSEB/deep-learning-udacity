## What is the aim of the repository?

This repository is about my lessons learned during the nanodegree. Feel free to look around! \
If you are about to follow the course, it may help you to see a possible solution.

My favorite is the transfer learning part. I added an additional folder where tweaked code for gpu support can be found. \
You can supply your own images (style and target) and see what kind of art you can create :)

## How to run the code locally?
- Create a virtual environment with all required libraries
- Activate environment
- Start jupyter notebook server

You will do something similar like this:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate deep-learning
jupyter notebook
```
You can find the environment.yml in this repo as well.

## How to run the code on a server?
Alternatively, you can also run jupyter notebook inside a container on a server (possibly with multiple gpus).
- tbd: build file upload
- tbd: build run command
- tbd: browser access
